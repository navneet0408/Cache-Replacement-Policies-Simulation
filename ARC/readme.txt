To execute the simulation we can use the the script “run.sh” provided along with the code. The script can be run for the following four functions:


ARC simulation:
This is used to simulate ARC cache replacement policy. Cache size and the trace file name (without “.lis” extension) are given as command line arguments. The output comes on the console. The usage is as follows:

Syntax: ./run.sh ARC <cache_size> <input_file_name>
Example: ./run.sh ARC 1024 P3


LRU simulation:
This is used to simulate LRU cache replacement policy. Cache size and the trace file name (without “.lis” extension) are given as command line arguments. The output comes on the console. The usage is as follows:

Syntax: ./run.sh LRU <cache_size> <input_file_name>
Example: ./run.sh LRU 1024 P3


ALL simulation:
This simulates both LRU and ARC for the cache sizes of 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384 and 32768. It is run on all the trace files provided as command line arguments (Space separated without “.lis” extension). The output is generated in the file “output.txt”. The usage is as follows:

Syntax: ./run.sh ALL <space separated trace file names (excluding ".lis" extension) ...>
Example: ./run.sh ALL P3 P4 P6


CLEAN:
This cleans up all the “.class” files, temporary files and the output file generated by the script. The usage is as follows:

Syntax: ./run.sh CLEAN



Care should be taken that the trace files should have a “.lis” extension (Extension is not provided to the script), and they should be in the same directory as the “run.sh” script and the source files.

Running the Simulation without using the script file:
For running the simulation without using the “run.sh” script, we will need to go to the directory containing the source files and type in the following commands:
#Compilation
javac Trace.java
javac LRU.java
javac ARC.java
#LRU Simulation
java -Xmx6g LRU <cacheSize> <Trace File Name (no “.lis” extension)>
#ARC Simulation
java -Xmx6g ARC <cacheSize> <Trace File Name (no “.lis” extension)>

Running Time:
The running time of the application increases with the increase in cache size. For cache sizes less than 8096, it takes less than a minute to finish. It takes approximately 5 minutes for simulating the trace file “P3.lis” for a cache size of 32768. The command “./run.sh ALL P3 P4 P6” takes approximately 45 minutes to finish. (The code was tested on the trace files P3.lis, P4.lis and P6.lis)
